# Newborn Child Wellness Record System



## Introduction

The **Digital Newborn Child Wellness Record** securely stores birth, growth, and vaccination data, enhancing child health tracking and administrative efficiency. Our system supports parents through development stages and promotes preventive healthcare, ensuring reliable and seamless access to vital records.

## Purpose and Importance

### Child Well-Being

Children have a fundamental right to well-being. Our system tracks growth rates, weight, height, and vaccination records to ensure the babyâ€™s health. Unlike traditional child wellness tracking record books, our system provides immediate access to health information.

### Early Intervention

Timely monitoring allows for early intervention in case of health deviations. Parents can also stay informed about upcoming clinical dates using our web application.

### Policy Development

Policymakers rely on accurate child data to design effective well-being policies. Our system ensures that only authorized users can access a child's health details.

## Main Key Components

1. **Birth Information:**
   - Captures birth details (date, time, weight, place, etc.).
   - Provides a historical, accurate reference for healthcare providers.

2. **Growth Milestones:**
   - Tracks growth parameters (weight, height, head circumference, etc.).
   - Alerts professionals to deviations from expected norms.

3. **Vaccination Records:**
   - Maintains a comprehensive record of vaccinations received.
   - Ensures timely administration of vaccines.

## Tools and Techniques
